Each of these element is called a **DOM**. The World Wide Web Consoritum(W3C) define's DOM as :
> The W3C DOM is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure and style of a document.

The DOM standard is separated into 3 parts :
- Core DOM -> The standard model for all document types.
- XML DOM -> The standard model for XML document.
- HTML DOM -> The standard model for HTML document.

From the tree view , we can refer to DOM as **document.head** or **document.h1** and so on.
This is  useful when we want to utilize front-end vulnerability like XSS.
