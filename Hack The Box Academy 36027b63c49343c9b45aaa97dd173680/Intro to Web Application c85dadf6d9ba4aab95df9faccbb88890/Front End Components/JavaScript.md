JavaScript is one the most used languages in the world. It is mostly used for web development and mobile development. 
JavaScript is usually used on the front end of an application to be executed within a browser.
Still there are implementation of back end JavaScript used to develop entire web application like NodeJs.

HTML and CSS are mainly in charge of how a web page looks like, JavaScript is usually used to control any functionality that the front end web pages requires.
Without JavaScript a webpage would be mostly static and would not have much more functionality or interactive element.

## Example
Within the page source code, JavaScript code is loaded with the \<script> tag, as follows
```html
<script type="text/javascript">
...JS code...
</script>
```
A web page can also load remote JavaScript code with src and script's link , as follows:
```html
<script src="./script.js"></script>
```
An example of basic use of JavaScript within a web page is the following:
```jsx
document.getElementById("button1").innerHTML = "Changed TextSS!"
```

## Usage
Most common web application heavily rely on JavaScript to drive all need functionality on the web page, like updating the web page view in real time, dynamically updating content in real time, accepting and processing user inputs, and many other potential functionalities.

JavaScript is also used to automate complex processes and perform HTTP requests to interact with with the back end components and send and retrieve data, through technologies like AJAX.

In addition to automation, JavaScript is also often used alongside CSS as previously mentioned to drive advanced animations that would not be possible with CSS alone. 
Whenever we visit an interactive and dynamic web pages that uses many advanced technologies we are seeing the result of the active JS.

All modern web browsers are equipped with the JAVASCRIPT engine that can execute javascript code on the client-side without relying on the back end webserver to update the page. This makes JavaScript is a very fast way to achieve a large number of process quickly.

## Frameworks
As web application become more advanced, it may be inefficient to use pure JavaScript to develop an entire web application from scratch. This is why a host of JavaScript frameworks have been introduced to improve the experience of web application development.

Some of most common JS frameworks are 
- AngularJS
- React.js
- Vue.js
- jQuery
