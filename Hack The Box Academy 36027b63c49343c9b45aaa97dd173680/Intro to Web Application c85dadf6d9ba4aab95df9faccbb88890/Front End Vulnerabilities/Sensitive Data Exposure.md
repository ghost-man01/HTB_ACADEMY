# Sensitive Data Exposure

In Sensitive Data Exposure we may find out hashes or passwords in the Source code.
We can still find out sensitive and valuable information in source code such as 
**test pages or directories**, **debugging parameters** or **hidden functionality**. 
There are various automated tools that we can use to analyze available page source code to identify the potential paths or directories and other sensitive information.

Leveraging these types of information can give us further access to the web application, which may help us attack the back end components to gain control over the server.
