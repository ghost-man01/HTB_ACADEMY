# Introduction

- Web applications are interactive application that run on web browsers.
- Web applications usually adopts **client-server architectures** to run interactions.

Client-server Architecture

- They have front end components [ "The website interface or what users see" ] that run on client-side(browsers) and other back end components (web application source code) that run on server side (back-end server/databases)

  

# Web Application vs Web sites :

## Web Sites :

- The websites that are static cannot be changed in real-time.
- Traditional websites were statically created to represent specific information, they cannot be  change with our interactions.
- To change these websites content, the corresponding page has to edited by developers manually.
- These types of static pages do not contain functions, and therefore do not produce real time changes.
- These types of websites also known as **web 1.0**

## Web Application :

- Most websites run web application or **web 2.0**
- They present dynamic content based on user experience.
- Fully functional and can perform various functionalities for the end-user
- Being modular running on any display size
- Running on any platform without being optimized.

## Web Applications vs Native Operating System Application :

### Advantages of WEB APPLICATIONS over Native OS Applications

- **Unlike Native OS application Web Applications are platform-independent**
    - Native OS application can run only on native OS.
    - Web applications are platform-independent and can run in a browser on any OS.
    - Web Applications don't need to install on user's OS and hence do not consume any space in end user's hard drive.
    - Web applications have functionality an executed remotely on the remote server.

  

- **Web applications are** **Version unity**.
    - All users accessing a web application use the same version and the same web application.
    - Which can be continuously update and modified without pushing updates to each user.
    - Web application can be updated from single location (webserver), without developing different builds for each platform.
    - It reduces maintenance and support costs removing the need to communicate changes to all users individually.
    

### Advantages of Native OS Application over Web Application

Mainly their operation speed and the ability to utilize native operating system libraries and local hardware.

Native application are built to utilize Native OS libraries they are much faster to load and interact with.

Native OS are more capable than web applications, as they have deeper integration to the operating system and are not limited to the browser's capabilities only.

> Most recently, **hybrid and progressive web application** are becoming more common. They utilize modern frameworks to run web applications using native OS capabilities and resources, making them faster than regular web applications and more capable.
> 

**Content Management System (CMS) such as Wordpress.**

We often find SQL injection vulnerabilities that uses Active Directory for authentication. 

A successful Password Spraying can often lead access to sensitive data such as email or even foothold directly into the corporate network environment.
