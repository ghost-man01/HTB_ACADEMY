"Insecure Direct Object Referencing ","When combined with a flaw such as broken access control, this can often be used to access user's file or functionality. Editing your user profile browsing to a page such as /user/701/edit-profile. If we change 701 to 702 we may edit another user's profile.",REAL WORLD SCENARIO
Broken Access Control,"Another example is an application that allows a user to register a new account. If the account registration functionality is designed poorly, a user may perform privilege escalation when registering. Consider the POST request when registering a new user, which submits the data username=bjones&password=Welcome1&email=bjones@inlanefreight.local&roleid=3. What if we can manipulate the roleid parameter and change it to 0 or 1. We have seen real-world applications where this was the case, and it was possible to quickly register an admin user and access many unintended features of the web application.",
