Title,Headers,Description
,Host,"The host header is used to specify the host being queried for the resources. This can be a domain name or IP address. HTTP servers can be configuration to host different websites, which are revealed based on hostname. This makes the host header an important enumeration target."
,User-Agent,"The User-agent header is used to describe the client requesting resources. For example; a browser or a library, this header can reveal a lot of information about client such browser, its version and operating system."
,Accept,The Accept header describes which media type client understand. It contains multiple media types separated by commas. The */* value signifies all media types.
,Cookie,"The Cookie header should contain cookie-value pair in the name=value format. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning the server has no way to identify clients connecting to it. This is a problem when hosting protected resources and content. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the client and server, which acts as an identifier. These are passed to the server per request, thus maintaining the client’s access. Cookies can also serve the other purposes, such as saving user preferences or session tracking. There can be multiple cookies in a single Cookie header separated by the semi-colon."
,Referer,"The Referer header denotes where the current request coming from. For example clicking a link on google search result would make https://google.com the referer. Trusting on this header can be dangerous as it can be easily, manipulated leading to unintended consequences."
,Authorization,"The Authorization HTTP header is another way for the server to identify clients. After successful authentication the server returns token unique to the client. Unlike cookies, tokens are stored only on the client-side and retrieved by the server per request. There are multiple types authentication types based on the webserver and application type used."
