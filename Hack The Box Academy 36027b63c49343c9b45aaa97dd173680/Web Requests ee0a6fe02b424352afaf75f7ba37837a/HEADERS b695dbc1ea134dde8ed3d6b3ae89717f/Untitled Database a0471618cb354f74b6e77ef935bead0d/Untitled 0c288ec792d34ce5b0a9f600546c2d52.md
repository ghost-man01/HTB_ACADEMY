Description: The Cookie header should contain cookie-value pair in the name=value format. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning the server has no way to identify clients connecting to it. This is a problem when hosting protected resources and content. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the client and server, which acts as an identifier.
